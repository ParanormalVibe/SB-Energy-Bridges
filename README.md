# Energy/Light Bridges

## How to Use

Energy bridge emitters can be crafted at a metalwork station, with the steel bridge emitter being immediately available to you from the first tier.

Usage of an energy bridge is simple. Just place it like a normal object, and interact with it to spawn/despawn a bridge in the direction that the emitter is facing. The higher tier the emitter, the longer the energy bridge will be. Energy bridges must be placed on an edge to function. The gif below shows usage of a steel emitter, which has the shortest range.

Emitters are wired, so they can also be activated using wired objects.

Bridge emitters are unlocked every two tiers, with the exception of the impervium emitter, which is unlocked at tier 10. Crafting a bridge emitter requires the same materials as higher tier lights, but with the addition of fuel. The tier unlocks are as follows:

- Tier 1 - Steel Emitter (20 blocks long)
- Tier 3 - Golden Emitter (40 blocks long)
- Tier 5 - Platinum Emitter (60 blocks long)
- Tier 7 - Cerulium Emitter (80 blocks long)
- Tier 9 - Rubium Emitter (100 blocks long)
- Tier 10 - Impervium Emitter (120 blocks long)

## Installation

Just extract the "Energy Bridges" folder from the zip file provided in the download to your Starbound/mods folder.

## Known bugs
- You may have to remove your emitter and place it again
- Impervium conveyors do not function properly underground
- You may have to reuse starmap/tech upgrades to unlock emitters if you have already used a number of them before installing this mod.
